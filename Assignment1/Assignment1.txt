5) output for ls -ld: dr-xr-xr-x 2 vaikuntamsp24 vaikuntamsp24 4096 Feb 28 20:12 myDir

   read permission. However, I was not able to use the touch function since I don't have writing 
   permissions. 

6) output: myFile.txt
  
   Answer:  When I performed all these actions I was able to move the file from myDir2 to myDir3. I then   
   used the ls function to see if it worked and appended that output to this file.
